# JavaScript-Rendering-HTML

Using the DOM API directly is much faster then changing HTML, it does not have to invoke the HTML parser and to rerender all the elements/tags contents.

The page has container for images comming from external API with fetch. 
JavaScript creating all page elements with the createElement method indise one root element.
